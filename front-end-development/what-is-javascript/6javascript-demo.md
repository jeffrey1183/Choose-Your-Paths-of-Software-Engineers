# JavaScript demo

Open [the following site](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) in a new tab and in that tab also open up developer tools. Then paste the following code:

```Javascript
document.getElementsByTagName("h1")[0].style.color = "#ff0000";
```

What happened when you ran that line of code in the JavaScript console?

Yes! That line of code changes the text in the first `<h1>` tag to red!

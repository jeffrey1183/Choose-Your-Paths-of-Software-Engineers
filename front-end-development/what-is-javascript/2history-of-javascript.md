# History of JavaScript
In 1995, Javascript is created in just 10 days by Brendan Eich. While Eich was working on the Netscape Navigator.

Netscape Navigator was one of the Internet's first web browsers. Before Eich created Javascript, websites just existed as HTML and CSS with the occasional plug-in or Java [applet](https://tw.voicetube.com/definition/applet).

# Java and Javascript

* Javascript in this course is totally different and not related to Java in any way.

The fact is Javascript has a weird past when it comes to names.

Javascript was originally called Livescript. It was changed back to Javascript as a marketing decision in order to the piggyback(背負) off the popularity of Java at that time.


TIP: HTML and CSS are markup languages. Markup languages are used to describe and define elements within a document. 
JavaScript is a programming language. Programming languages are used to communicate instructions to a machine. Programming languages can be used to control the behavior of a machine and to express algorithms.

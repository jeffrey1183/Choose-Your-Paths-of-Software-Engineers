# Numbers
Defining a number in JavaScript is actually pretty simple. The Number data type includes any positive or negative integer, as well as decimals. 

Entering a number into the console will return it right back to you.

```3```
>Returns: 3

# Arithmetic operations

You can also perform calculations with numbers pretty easily. Basically type out an expression the way you would type it in a calculator.

```2+2```
>Returns: 4

You can try more complicated expressions.

```
2 + 10 - 19 + 4 - 90 + 1
```
>Returns -92

# Comparing numbers
Just like in mathematics, you can compare two numbers to see if one’s greater than, less than, or equal to the other.

```5 > 10```
>Returns false

Comparisons between numbers will either evaluate to true or false.

The values true and false have significant importance in JavaScript. These values are called **Booleans** and are another data type in JavaScript. 

Later in this lesson, you’ll learn more about why Booleans are so important in programming.

# Indexing
Did you know that you can access individual characters in a string? To access an individual character, you can use the character's location in the string, called its index. 
>你知道對於每一個字串，我們其實是可以 access 每一個字嗎？我們可以依據字的位置、序號(index)去做 access。

Just put the index of the character inside square brackets (starting with [0] as the first character) immediately after the string. For example:
>寫法就是在字串後面加上這種 `[]` 括號，裡面寫上字的 index。


```"James"[0];```
>Returns: "J"

It would be a lot easier to keep track of all these animals if we have a database of them. I'll bet the real zoos do that too. Keep record of all of these animals that live there, and what they need to eat, and so on. Let's see how we might do that.
>我們這裡來舉一個動物園的例子，動物園會需要一個資料庫來記錄動物的名字與飲食習慣等資料，我們來試著做做看。

So using the data in the animal's table, try answering these questions.

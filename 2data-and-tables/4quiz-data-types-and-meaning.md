As a programmer, we're familiar with the idea of data types. A string like Alan is a different type from a numerical value like 188. But 188 is the same type as 72 even though they present values with different meanings. 
>身為一個 programmer，我們對數字和字串很熟悉，然而 188 跟 72 雖然都是數字但他們是代表著不同意義。

One is the height in centimeters and the other is the weight in kilograms. Every column in the database table will have some type associated with it. All the values in that column will be of the same type. But, moreover, they also  have the same kind of meaning. We wouldn't mix centimeters and kilograms in the same column. The database system itself doesn't know which numbers are centimeters and which numbers are kilograms. We have to keep track of that for ourselves when we write code.

#Introduction to Using Objects
An object is a way of organizing data and functionality in something we can use as programmers, Hence the term, object oriented programming. As an iOS developer, you'll definitely want to know about objects. And in this session we'll practice identifying them in the real world.
> Object 可拆分成 data 跟 functionality 兩個部分，下面會提到。身為 iOS developer 你必須了解 object，本節課我們會開始認識 object。

When you run the Maze application, there is a lot more going on than meets the eye. Behind the scenes, the Maze app consists of a larger system of interconnected objects.
>當你 run Maze 這個 app 時，其實有很多東西在背後運行，整個 app 是由很多 object 互相連結而成。

You had a chance to interact with one object already—the Robot object—and you sent it messages to move around the maze.
> 你有機會先跟 Robot object 這個 object 先做互動，你可以傳給他一些訊息讓 app 內的機器人移動。我們可以從下圖看到 Robot object 的 data 跟 functionality。

Objects like the Robot allow us to group related pieces of data. Once the data is grouped, we can more easily interact with it. For example, with the Robot object we can store how the robot looks and operates. Then, to interact with it, we send it instructions such as moveUp and moveDown. We’ll talk more about objects later, but for now remember that objects are capable of encapsulating data (“what it is composed of”) and functionality (“how it operates”).
> Robot 這個 object 會儲存 robot 的外觀跟操作，我們把相關資料 group 起來

In addition to the Robot object, the Maze app creates another special kind of object called a struct. Specifically, each time you sent instructions to the Robot object, a Move struct was created.

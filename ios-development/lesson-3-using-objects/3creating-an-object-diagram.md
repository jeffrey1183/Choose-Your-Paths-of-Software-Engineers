#Creating an Object Diagram
Let's pause for a moment and talk about how to create the object diagrams you've been seeing. We've broken this process into 3 steps: identify objects, relationships, and multiplicity.
>我們先暫停一下，先講如何 create 剛剛看到的 object diagrams，可分成三個步驟 
1. identify objects 
2. relationships 
3. multiplicity


If you've never created an object diagram from scratch, then it can be confounding the first time. However, making an object diagram should be a very natural process once you know how to identify objects. For many, you may already be identifying objects in everyday experiences and not even know it!
>如果你沒有畫過 object diagram 的草圖，第一次可能比較驚恐。

I'd like to take a moment and show you the process of  creating an object diagram. You might also hear this process referred to as object decomposition. That is, we're taking that's a big object like an app, and we're breaking it down into an individual components. Now there is no right or wrong way to do this. If a hundred people create an object diagram for an app, there might be 100 completely different diagrams.
>我們要花點時間來學怎麼畫 object diagram，也有人稱之為 object decomposition。如果我們把 app 想像成一個 object，我們把 app 拆解成許多 components，這個並沒有所謂的正確與錯誤，可能 100個人拆解，會拆解成 100 種完全不同的結果。

Also there is some formal and informal way to create them. A formal way might be creating an object diagram using the Universal Modeling Language or UML. And an example object diagram's given here on the left. Now the UML as the modeling language contains a bunch of standard symbols and icons that are helpful for laying out the components of a project. But for many, UML can be really bulky to work with. I am more the fan of informal approach that takes some ideas from UML, but it doesn't get bogged down in the nitty gritty details. And an example of a more informal object diagram is given here on the right.
>畫 object diagram 比較正式的方法是用 UML 去畫，就像左邊的圖一樣會用到一些標準符號，但 UML 比較麻煩。作者比較喜歡用較不正式但不拘泥於細節的方式去畫，像右圖一樣。

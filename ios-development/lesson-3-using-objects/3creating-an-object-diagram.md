#Creating an Object Diagram
Let's pause for a moment and talk about how to create the object diagrams you've been seeing. We've broken this process into 3 steps: identify objects, relationships, and multiplicity.
>我們先暫停一下，先講如何 create 剛剛看到的 object diagrams，可分成三個步驟 
1. identify objects 
2. relationships

#Syllabus
Using Objects
* Objects are a foundational skill in Swift programming. We'll look at how they're used in some apps in the real world.

Variables
* Variables allow us to store information so we can use it later when we need it. Learn what variable types are available in Swift and how to declare them.

Writing Structs with Properties
* Structs provide us a nice way to group multiple values into a usable package. Learn how to declare and us structs in Swift.

Operators and Expressions
* Add, subtract, multiply, divide, and more using operators and expressions in Swift!

Pirate Fleet Prep
* Pirate Fleet is a Battleship clone with a small twist: there are mines!

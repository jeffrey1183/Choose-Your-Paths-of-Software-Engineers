#Launching the Maze App

At this point, we assume you have finished installing Xcode. If you have not, then you will have difficulty following the upcoming content. Also, before continuing forward, you will need to [download the project files for Maze app](https://github.com/udacity/ios-nd-robot-maze-1/archive/swift-3.zip). Once you've completed both those items, then join us in launching the Maze app.

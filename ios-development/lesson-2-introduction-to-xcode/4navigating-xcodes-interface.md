If you open an Xcode project, we can see that Xcode is divided into five main sections: the Navigator on the left, the Editor area in the middle of the screen, the Debug area at the bottom, the Utilities on the right, and the toolbar at the top.
>Xcode 的介面可以分成五個區塊，左邊是 Navigator，中間是編輯的區塊，下面是用來 debug，右邊是 utilities，toolbar 在上面。

The Navigator allows us to examine the different parts of our Xcode project. Currently, the Navigator displays the Project navigator. The Project navigator lets you see all files contained in a project. If you cannot see the Project navigator, make sure you have the Project navigator selected using the icons at the top of the Navigator (it's the file icon on the far left).The Navigator gives us many options for viewing a project.

By using a keyboard shortcut (a special combination of keys), you can select the Project navigator. The keyboard shortcut to select the Project navigator is the Command key and the 1 key at the same time. It is abbreviated as ⌘1, ⌘+1, or Command+1 (they all mean the same thing). Also, if you click View in the top toolbar, and then go to Navigators, you can see the shortcut information listed for the Project navigator.
>我們可以用 Command 加上 1，Command 加上 2，這些快捷鍵去切換 Navigator

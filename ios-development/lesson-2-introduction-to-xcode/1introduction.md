#Introduction

The instructor for the course is Rod.
In the first part of this course, we're going to build an app that lets you record your voice and play it back with sound effects.
>這門課的老師是 Rod，我們將會做一個可以錄音的 App，播放聲音時還可以加一些效果。

This course we assumes you're familiar with the basic programming concepts, like if statements, loops and classes.
>這門課會假設你已經有 if statements, loops 和 classes 這些概念，你不需要寫過 iOS App 或 Swift，課程中都會講到。

Developing for iOS is a lot of fun. You get to write apps that you can carry right in your pocket.

Let's start by looking at the steps we'll take to build this app.
>接下來會介紹課程內容，開發 iOS 很有趣，好好享受吧~

#From Xcode to App
So what all happened when we hit the play button? Well, Xcode began working in the background to launch the Maze app on the iOS Simulator.

The Swift compiler makes this all happen. The Swift compiler is a piece of software that translates the Swift code we write into an executable app that a device like your phone, tablet, or watch can understand. The process by which the compiler translates your code into an executable app is known as building.

#Course Summary
After you’ve completed this course, you’ll be ready to dive into the Data Analyst Nanodegree, which is the ultimate stepping stone to a career as a Data Analyst!
>上完這一部分的課，如果要更專精就可以上 [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) 這門課。

#Why Take This Course?
This course will introduce you to the world of data analysis. You'll learn how to go through the entire data analysis process, which includes:

* Posing a question
* Wrangling your data into a format you can use and fixing any problems with it
* Exploring the data, finding patterns in it, and building your intuition about it
* Drawing conclusions and/or making predictions
* Communicating your findings

You'll also learn how to use the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to write code that's cleaner, more concise, and runs faster.
>上這門課你可以學到 data analysis 的流程：從假設問題、針對問題整理相關資料、探索資料找出 pattern、作結論與預測，最後跟大家說你的發現。

#Syllabus
####Dictionaries
In this lesson you will get an awareness of an dictionaries, an important in Python that you will going to encounter in the rest of this path.

####Data Analysis Process
In this lesson, you will learn about the data analysis process, which includes posing a question, wrangling and exploring your data, drawing conclusions and/or making predictions, and communicating your findings. You will complete an analysis of Udacity student data using pure Python, with minimal reliance on additional libraries.
>學習資料分析的流程，會實作一個分析，是關於 Udacity 學生的資料。

####NumPy and Pandas for 1D Data
In this lesson, you will start learning to use NumPy and Pandas to make the data analysis process easier. This lesson focuses on features that apply to one-dimensional data. You'll learn to use NumPy arrays, Pandas Series, and vectorized operations.

####NumPy and Pandas for 2D Data
In this lesson, you'll continue learning about NumPy and Pandas, this time focusing on two-dimensional data. You'll learn to use two-dimensional NumPy arrays and Pandas DataFrames. You'll also learn to group your data and to combine data from multiple files.

#Getting Started with Data Analysis
The following content is broken into two core pieces:

####Introduction To Dictionaries
Before you dive into the full Intro to Data Analysis course, you'll need a solid understanding of dictionaries. If you decide to enroll in the [Data Analyst Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002), you will need this as a prerequisite as well. The following content on dictionaries comes from the same course as much of the concepts you covered in Code Your Own Quiz.

####Intro to Data Analysis
You will be taking Intro to Data Analysis with Caroline. This course is a good first step towards understanding the data analysis process as a whole. Before delving into each individual phase, it is important to learn the difference between all phases of the process and how they relate to each other. This course also covers the Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, which are indispensable tools for doing data analysis in Python. Their many convenient functions and high performance make writing data analysis code a lot easier!

This course will require that you search and utilize documentation. Don’t hesitate to search through the documentation that exists for the Python libraries covered in this course:

NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
The next two lessons will direct you to set up your computer by installing the Anaconda distribution and Jupyter Notebook -- two very useful tools for data analysts.

As you make your way through these installation instructions, you'll see that students in the Data Analyst Nanodegree are encouraged to set up a Python 3 environment. We recommend setting up a Python 3 environment and a Python 2 environment, as both will be useful for the content that follows.

Also, note that the forum links provided in the following course material is only accessible to students enrolled in the Data Analyst Nanodegree. For questions, visit the IPND forums.

Let's get started!

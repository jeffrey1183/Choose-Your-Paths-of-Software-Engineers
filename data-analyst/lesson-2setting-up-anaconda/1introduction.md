#Why Anaconda?
[Anaconda](https://anaconda.org) is a distribution of packages built for data science. It comes with conda, a package and environment manager. You'll be using conda to create environments for isolating your projects that use different versions of Python and/or different packages. You'll also use it to install, uninstall, and update packages in your environments. Using Anaconda has made my life working with data much more pleasant.

A lot of time we're working with projects that requires different library versions or different version of Python you even. My experience and many other people. It's really difficult to get all these versions to play nicely on one computer. To solve the problem we use virtual environments managed with libraries such as Virtualenv. Virtual environment let you separate libraries required by different project, so you can avoid conflicts.
